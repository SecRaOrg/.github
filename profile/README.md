# ⚡ SecRa – The Security Radar for Public Repos

**SecRa** is an AI-powered vulnerability scanner that detects real security issues in **public GitHub repositories** — fast, accurate, and non-intrusive.

We scan:
- 🔑 Exposed credentials (tokens, secrets, keys)
- 🧪 Vulnerable dependencies
- ⚙️ Misconfigured GitHub Actions workflows
- 🚨 Injection risks and unsafe patterns
- 🌐 Cleartext endpoints and insecure cryptography

All without cloning your repo.

## 💡 Why SecRa?

✅ Scans real files via GitHub API — no cloning, no noise  
✅ Free for public repositories  
✅ Built for security-conscious developers, maintainers, and researchers

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. We parse public GitHub repos via the GitHub API  
2. Extract key files (`README`, `.env`, `.github/workflows`, configs)  
3. Analyze them using AI agents trained to detect real vulnerabilities  
4. Return structured results with severity, location, and suggested fixes
